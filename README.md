## Game for First-Discovery-of-Preferences

My CSS, JavaScript, HTML level is intermediate and I have developed quite a few games using JavaScript game frameworks (Quintus/Phaser). I have also made an HTML5 game using Blockly.js (Google’s visual programming editor builder) long back by interfacing the same with a Phaser game and hence interfacing the Infusion Preferences Framework with a Phaser game would be quite achievable.  

Instead of quickly beginning with coding and developing modules I thought to spend more time on understanding the idea since at the first sight it looks simple but going deep and understanding the various use cases brings out the actual challenge.

Since it’s a rule of thumb that spending more time on designing the architecture/use cases and having a proper understanding of what is to be implemented makes the coding part easy, I concentrated on the gameplay design.

Moreover, having an educational technology background and having worked with NPOs on similar project has helped me to get a better understanding of what is actually wanted out of the project and has enabled me to understand key terms like “Learning to Learn” and “Learning Preferences” which I feel a developer should completely understand before starting with this project. As a result of the understanding, I have been able to apply my creativity to bolster the idea and propose a gamified Infusion Preference Framework based educational game.

Danayo’s link which pointed me towards the various demos of the Infusion Preference Framework and Justin_o’s link (http://gpii.net/) has cleared my doubts on the idea of setting preferences. http://gpii.net/ConsumerBenefits and http://gpii.net/EducationBenefits took me through the various benefits of GPII. **Assistance on Demand (AOD)**, **Access and Learning**, **Instant Setup** as mentioned in GPII Benefits Section would be achieved through the game.

As per my understanding the term “Learning to Learn” is self-descriptive. We all have different preferences while learning and we all learn in way which is different from others (it can be the learning modes like some prefer videos, some prefer written notes) but that process is implicit. Learning to learn makes that process explicit and helps become more effective learners through reflection and the application of learning strategies.


##Objective of the game:

* First-time discovery of digital, learning preferences and gameplay preferences.

* Teach/inform about the idea of setting preferences and involving them in a process of learning to learn.

* Setting the digital preferences up in a gamified approach.

* Guide user to a game which is based on his/her preferences.
*
* Since this is “aimed at user groups who may not have a lot of experience in using digital devices” a good game would be to teach them using the keyboard (may be it virtual/physical) itself.

* Along with teaching them how to use the keyboard, considering that our target users are predominantly kids/students teaching them some mathematical skills and vocabulary would be good.

* While playing the game they would be revealed about their learning preferences (again, involving them in a process of learning to learn). This would be again using a gamified approach.

*	This would be more of a discovery rather than setting or choosing something up and would be based on what the user does while playing the game. Say there would be arithmetic problems and a gameplay would be such created that reveals whether the user prefers to use standard computational procedures or prefers mental tricks to solve them. In this way the kid/student would also learn some mental math skills to solve arithmetic problems. 

*	At any point of time user would be free to change his/her preferences.

*	Finally, a dashboard containing a timeline of how preferences change as the user continues through to the game.

### Gamified Preference Settings

* **Traditional way** the infusion preference framework is using.

![Trafitional way](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/First-Discovery-of-Preferences/blob/master/img/fluid.png "Traditional way")

* **A gamified approach** (Step1: A mission is posed)

![Mission](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/First-Discovery-of-Preferences/blob/master/img/fluid1.png "Mission")

* Step 2 (The user is taken through an interactive game in which he would be using a particular method to achieve the posed mission)

** The virtual keyboard would be implemented in a far better way that doesn’t affect the game size and provides a seamless user experience. This is just for demonstration purpose.)

* Step 3: The method adopted is nothing but the user’s preference (say in this case he uses the virtual keyboard to type the name of the fruit) and in this case it’s a digital preference. By telling the user about his preference we are applying the idea of learning to learn.

* A few more UI Mockups for Preferences Settings

### Gameplay Preference

*	Which background you prefer? Dim /Vivid [This can be again gamified]

* Which character you prefer? Several character options.
*
*	Which enemy you prefer? Several enemy options
*
* Which arithmetic operations you would want to practice?
*
* Should the enemy be moving fast? Slow? How much?

* You prefer timer or health based objectives ?

### Learning Preferences

* An interactive tutorial on Multplication technique based on standard procedures

* Practice exercises based on standard procedures

* **Mental Math tricks** : A simple Vedic math trick of multiplying a two-digit number with 11. Let us consider 52*11.
52*11 = 5_2 = 5(5+2)2 = 572. Pingu taking the user through the interactive Mental Math tutorial (This will be more appealing when the animation could be seen)

* Practice exercises based on mental math tricks

* Vocabulary and getting acsustomed with using keyboard (Typing the correct spelling would make the bird drop the fruit)

* UI elements (in game dialogs)

### Other features

**Instant Setup** : As qouted from http://gpii.net/ConsumerBenefits *"the GPII’s personalization profile will allow users to have the computer automatically invoke the features they need when they approach a computer. All they need to do is enter a code, plug in a USB drive, swipe a card, or bring their cell phone near the computer -- whatever action the user can conveniently perform."*

This could be achieved in the game. I've always found people having issues with playing games in devices other than their pesonal ones just because the setting don't match and setting up preferences for people having disablities could be a a difficult task. The various preference settings data would be stored in a cloud platform and each user will be assigned an unique ID. May they be playing the game in the browser (web app) or in their desktop or in their mobile phones (this would be achieved through Apache Cordova/Crosswalk project , they can enter that particular ID and the game would automatically invoke their prferences.

** Assistance on demand** : As qouted from *"The GPII also enables a whole new range of assistive services-on-demand where a user can bring up an assistant to help them for just a minute."*

For people with disabilties the game would have several assistive prefernces.

* For **deaf users** there would be visual asistance and captions and instructions turned on which will assist them throughout the game.
* For **users with poor vision** there would be voice assistance and alerts to help them through various parts of the game.
* For **blind users** voice assistance is not enough. The idea of setting preferences can be made real fun and interactive for them. I have rcently made a unity based gesture controlled game using the Myo armband and I can make this game to work with such devices. Setting preferences would be a fun then for blind people too as they would be able to do it just by moving their hand alongwith playing the game being assisted by the voice assistant. 

**Access and Learning** : Already voice assistance is being implmented in the game for users with poor vision and blind users and that would also help users who can't read.
